so im thinking about making a study location service. you input your location, and then we scrape google maps with their api for all cafes nearby, and return all the ones in the region that are still open at the time


Your Task (≤ 6 hours): Identify a real student pain point (e.g. assignment deadlines across portals, class schedules, dining hall menus, gym hours, office hours, etc.). Pitch your widget idea in a few sentences within the README (what problem it solves, what info it shows, how it makes a student’s day easier). Build a prototype (React or plain JS is fine). Focus on clarity and approach over polish. Deploy to Vercel and share the live link (also share link to GitHub repo.)

What We’re Looking For: Taste, Production Intuition, Code Quality, and a clear understanding of your user
